		<parameter key="keyword_reply1" value="JOB? Know your manners, fool. I'm the king!" />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply2" value="Yes, are you blind? I'm standing right here in front of you." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply3" value="That is just out-rageous." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply4" value="You are the one who should offer me free items. But I could always promote you if you're really worthy it. And I have fire bugs too." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply5" value="The former kings ruled from Celeres, but since this grand castle was built to my honour I decided to move here." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply6" value="I named this castle to Castle Dine." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply7" value="Lithaton is the grand continent which I rule. But it's not all. My powers reach to Dustwit aswell as Flantania Isle, and both Hagal and Gardar is under my command." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply8" value="Zertic has served me before, but I know he dislikes me. He shows me respect and as long as he continues with that I am satisfied. " />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply9" value="Doc? Is that what they call him these days? Well, Doc or not, he's a man of honour." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply10" value="My grandfather knew Natalon. " />

    <parameter key="keyword_reply13" value="Celeres is a very interesting city, although I personally prefer Casteldine. All the kings before me ruled from Celeres." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply14" value="Adanac is to me a quite unimportant city. It is isolated and not interesting." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply15" value="Ashbere is the elven tree city. It's impressive even though it's built by our enemies. The elves from Ashbere are very aggressive, but they constitute no threat to us." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply16" value="The outlaws from Goldtol thinks they can escape my troops. We are still raiding that camp now and then to clean up a little." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply17" value="Don't you know my name, fool?" />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply18" value="Hail me." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply19" value="A queen? Where?" />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply20" value="Dark magic is nothing we shall discuss now. Only if you bring me true marks of evil, I will destroy them and give you the honour you are worthy of." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply21" value="I know only one person who is capable of dealing with the true secrets of magic, and even though I dislike him I must agree with that he knows what he does. Zertic is his name." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply22" value="If you bring me marks of evil I will praise your name forever, |PLAYERNAME|." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply23" value="We fight evil, don't we?" />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply24" value="He is certainly amusing." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply25" value="I recently asked him to be my royal astrolog. He knows much about our world, too." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply26" value="May he rest in peace." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply27" value="King Celero III was my father and the former king." />
