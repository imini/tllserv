<parameter key="keyword_reply9" value="Archdemos are phenomenal creatures, but they tend to kill anyone who they dislike. It's just a matter of time before they find me doing something they disapprove to." /> 
<parameter key="keyword_reply10" value="Liches are the servants of the darker powers. Especially archdemons seems to have understood this and so did the liches become their servants." />

<parameter key="keyword_reply14" value="He, exactly as the archdemons, has left the religion of Zathroth and proceeded higher. His past is dark, my friend. I don't know if anyone but himself can give a full account of it, though." /> 
<parameter key="keyword_reply15" value="Dark magic is something which tears your soul apart. Eventually, your tarnished soul will be on the brink of dissolving. The last fragment of soul is kept alive by the evil inside you." /> 
<parameter key="keyword_reply16" value="Archdemons believes that they are higher than the gods, thus they abandon any other religion than the one they alone create." /> 
<parameter key="keyword_reply17" value="I believe in the archdemons. Not in any god." /> 
<parameter key="keyword_reply18" value="He is a follower of Zathroth, and I believe if he ever happen to come here he'd be killed by the archdemons." />
