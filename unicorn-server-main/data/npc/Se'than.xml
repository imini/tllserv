		<parameter key="keyword_reply1" value="I am the ruler of Ashbere. I could very well be your ruler, so mind your manners." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply2" value="Khamos was the founder of this village. He died long ago, but left his fabulous fortune securely protected in impenetrable vaults here in Ashbere." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply3" value="Elves are intelligent creatures, far more intelligent than humans, as a matter of fact." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply4" value="A village, or perhaps even a city, which is famously known for its greatness." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply5" value="Celeres is a pathetic human settlement and it's only a matter of time before my troops will penetrate its defences and seize the city." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply6" value="Casteldine is far more well guarded than Celeres. I would almost say its thick wall and strong defence makes it an invulnerable human settlement." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply7" value="King Arturo is the human leader, I remember. He rules from Casteldine." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply8" value="Paschendale is a horrendous place, really. I would not even wish my worst enemy to go there, but some times we have to inspite of the dreadful creatures living there." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply9" value="What's on your mind, really, |PLAYERNAME|? Do you believe I will give you anything for coming here and disturbing?" />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply10" value="Se'Than is elvish. You don't understand it." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply11" value="I remember that a man from Adanac sold me this cowl. He said it had a very interesting effect on certain people. Why don't you talk to him?" />
