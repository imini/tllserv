		<parameter key="keyword_reply4" value="I am a ninja. As you might have noticed, I live here alone. My former clan decided to leave me, they found my behaviour not as ruthless as their." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply5" value="These are the Barren Cliffs. Its gigantic surface stretches over the south and east part of Dustwit. Be aware of getting lost here, you might end up as a prey for the dangerous wild life." />
    <parameter key="keyword_reply6" value="I know Tha'Reen, it's a settlement in the west. I've never been there, and I don't suppose I would be welcome either. I prefer it here." />

    <parameter key="keyword_reply11" value="I need to pull revenge upon my former people. I know how, I do have a plan, but I believe I'm a little too old to execute it smoothly enough not to get injured meanwhile." />
