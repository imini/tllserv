		<parameter key="keyword_reply1" value="I am a jeweller." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply2" value="Lithaton is the main continent on which we are standing at this very moment." /> 
		<parameter key="keyword_reply3" value="I have pearls and small jewels." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply4" value="At the moment I have small amethysts, diamonds, sapphires, rubies and emeralds." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply5" value="I heard rumours about Pire Vams castle. Someone had apparently solved the riddle and entered the house. They were four guys, but I'm afraid they haven't returned yet." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply6" value="Pire Vam's castle is to the north-west. That is all I know. He's scaring me." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply7" value="Long live the king. A shame he moved to Casteldine, though. Celeres is such a nice city." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply8" value="Watch out so the sheriff doesn't hear you. He'll arrest you for talking about it." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply9" value="Celeres is a beautiful city. Did you know that king Arturo has lived here once?" />

    <parameter key="keyword_reply14" value="Creyo shall rot in hell. Or at least in prison." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply15" value="Sally doesn't deserve to be in prison. She's a nice, young lady who made a mistake." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply16" value="Hehe. I think Steve is afraid of me. I don't know why." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply17" value="Lendan is living outside the city. The only interesting thing with him is that he has a flying carpet." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply18" value="Dixi is... weird." /> 
    <parameter key="keyword_reply19" value="Rooster is my all too wealthy, and noisy, neighbor. All his customers drives me insane." />
